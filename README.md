# Topsis-Prabhsimrat-102317135
This project implements the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method for multi-criteria decision making.

The program accepts an input CSV file containing alternatives and criteria values, along with user-defined weights and impacts, and computes:

1. Normalized decision matrix
2. Weighted normalized matrix
3. Ideal best and ideal worst solutions
4. TOPSIS score for each alternative
5. Final ranking of alternatives

The solution is implemented as a command-line tool and is also published as a Python package on PyPI.
Here is the link for the PyPI package : https://pypi.org/project/Topsis-Prabhsimrat-102317135/1.0.0/
